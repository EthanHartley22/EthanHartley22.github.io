summary: "Within the broader panel, I discussed the emerging role of artificial intelligence in modeling crop yields under climate change, emphasizing its potential to integrate diverse spatial and temporal data. I also presented my current research, which leverages these capabilities to enhance empirical accuracy and support global yield projections."

The session will have four short presentations (about 10 minutes each), each using new and different empirical method to model the effect of climate change on crop yields and other economic outcomes. The last 30 minutes of the session will be dedicated to a panel discussion about the different empirical approaches, their strengths and weaknesses, and how empirical analysis of climate change impacts will evolve in the future.
