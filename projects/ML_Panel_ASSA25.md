Machine learning has revolutionized international trade and economics, creating opportunities for efficiency, precision, and strategic insight. ML enhances demand forecasting, allowing businesses to better anticipate market needs and optimize supply chains. ML models predict trade flows, identify emerging markets, and assess geopolitical risks, aiding firms in making informed decisions.

In international economics, ML facilitates the analysis of complex economic indicators, improving the accuracy of economic forecasts and enabling more responsive policy interventions. By processing vast datasets, ML models can identify trends and patterns that inform economic strategies, helping policymakers craft data-driven strategies for economic stability and growth. The integration of ML with economic modeling has refined economic forecasting, allowing for more adaptive and targeted economic policies.

To explore these advancements, our panel session will bring together leading experts to discuss the transformative role of ML in these fields. Panelists will share insights on current trends, challenges, and future directions, providing a comprehensive overview of how ML is reshaping international trade and economics.
