    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>
    I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the Department of Economics. The core of my research lies in exploring the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the established econometric framework, with a strong focus on uncertainty, international economics, and energy & environmental economics.

      My present work with Dr. Michael Roberts and Dr. Nori Tarui, conducted in collaboration with the Hawaii State Energy Office and Hawaiian Electric Company, centers on Hawaii's energy landscape. I am dedicated to contributing concrete policy initiatives that can facilitate decarbonization efforts. At present, my focus is on variable pricing initiatives, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), and modeling for capacity planning.
