    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>
    I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the Department of Economics. The core of my research lies in exploring the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the established econometric framework, with a strong focus on uncertainty, international economics, and energy & environmental economics.

    My present work, led by Dr. Nori Tarui and conducted in partnership with the Hawaii Data Science Institute and the Hawaii State Energy Office, centers on the analysis of Hawaii's energy markets. Our primary objective is to contribute to Hawaii's net zero ambitions by investigating and proposing strategies related to EV adoption, renewable energy alternatives, and dynamic pricing schemes.
